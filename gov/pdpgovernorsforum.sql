Also speaking at the party’s NEC meeting, the Chairman of PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jubrin, said that the party will never change its name.

The capital is Umuahia, and the major commercial city is Aba, which was formerly a British colonial government outpost in the region, and is also one of the most populated areas in Nigeria. Abia state was created in 1991 from part of Imo State. It is one of the constituent states of the Niger Delta region. It is also the 5th most industrialized state in the country, and has the 4th highest index of human development in the country, with numerous economic activities and fast growing populations as recorded by the United Nations in early 2018. The state also houses the biggest cattle market In Nigeria sited at the Enugu-PH Highway in UmuNneochi L.G.A</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name \"Abia\" is an abbreviation of four of Abia state\'s densely populated regions Aba, Bende, Isuikwuato, and Afikpo.[10]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their traditional language, Igbo is in widespread use.  English is also widely spoken, and serves as the official language in governance and business. Abia\'s over 2.4 million people are mainly Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GEOGRAPHY</h3><p>\r\nAbia State, which occupies about 6,320 square kilometres, is bounded on the north and northeast by the states of Anambra, Enugu, and Ebonyi. To the west of Abia is Imo State, to the east and southeast are Cross River State and Akwa Ibom State respectively and to the south is Rivers State. The southern part of the State lies within the riverine part of Nigeria, it is a low-lying tropical rainforest with some oil-palm brush, the southern portion gets heavy rainfall of about 2,400 millimetres (94 ins.) per year and is especially intense between the months of April through October. The rest of the State is moderately high plain and wooded savanna.The most important rivers in Abia State are the Imo and Aba Rivers which flow into the Atlantic Ocean through Akwa Ibom State.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMY</h3><p>\r\nCrude oil and gas production is a prominent activity, as it contributes over 39% of the State\'s GDP.However, the indigenous oil companies - through the Marginal Fields Programme (MFP) - have not found it easy to attract the requisite funding and infrastructural capacity to explore some of the marginal oil fields which are about 50 in the State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manufacturing sector only accounts for 2% of the GDP. The industrial centre of the state is in Aba, with textile manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, soap, plastics, cement, footwear, and cosmetics. In addition to the above, Abia State Government owns a 9,000- capacity multipurpose International Conference Centre in Umuahia. This edifice of international standard was built by Governor T.A Orji to enhance tourism as well as boost the state economy through hosting of major International and Local events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representing 27% of the GDP, agriculture which employs 70%of the state workforce is the second economic sector of Abia. With its adequate seasonal rainfall, Abia has much arable land that produces yams, maize, potatoes, rice, cashews, plantains, taro, and cassava. Oil palm is the most important cash crop. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION</h3>\r\n<p>There are over 100 oil wells and 3 installed flow stations in Abia State. There is also an associated gas plant, Abia/NNPC gas plant. As of 2012, boundary Commission said it returned 42 oil wells from neighbouring Rivers State to Abia. This would have meant Abia being fourth largest oil producing state in the country. Oil giant, Shell, holds most of the licenses for the wells in the State and has concentrated on the estimated 50 wells that are considered high-yield.</p>\r\n \r\n<h3>UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGES</h3><p>\r\nThere are four Universities in the State: the Federal-owned Michael Okpara University of Agriculture at Umudike, the state-owned Abia State University in Uturu, and the Gregory University Uturu and Rhema University in Aba, both privately-owned. There are two tertiary hospitals, the Federal Medical Center in Umuahia and the Abia State University Teaching Hospital in Aba, which serve as referral hospitals in the State. The Abia State Polytechnic is also in the city of Aba. There are two major power plants in Abia, The Alaoji Power plant and the Geometric Power plant. Abia is one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria and has been a \"haven\" for foreign investors. The state\'s population has grown rapidly since its creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>TRAVEL</h3><p>\r\nThe nearest airport to Abia is Sam Mbakwe Cargo Airport (Owerri Airport), an hour drive to Umuahia and Aba; and Port Harcourt International Airport, 2 hours. Akwa Ibom Airport (Akwa Ibom State) can also serve would-be visitors. The distance between Uyo (Akwa Ibom) and Umuahia (Abia) is: 73.28 kilometres (45.53 mi).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe rail transport is also another means of travel, very effective but currently on revitalization. Aba is connected to Port Harcourt by rail. The coastal parts of the State are equally accessible with boats and canoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>POLITICS</h3><p>\r\nThe State Government is led by a democratically-elected executive Governor who works closely with members of the state\'s House of Assembly. The capital city is Umuahia. There are Seventeen (17) local government areas (LGAs).</p><p>\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Nigeria became a democracy and Orji Uzor Kalu contested on the platform of the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) and won the Governorship election in Abia State. Consequently, he was sworn-in on 29 May 1999. In 2003, when it was time for fresh elections, Kalu re-contested on the platform of the PDP and got a second mandate to govern. Theodore Orji (PPA) defeated Onyema Ugochukwu (PDP) in the 2007 general elections to become Abia\'s next Governor. In 2011, Theodore Orji decamped from PPA to the PDP and was re-elected for another four-year tenure.</p><p>\r\n\r\nOn 11 April 2015, Okezie Ikpeazu was voted as the ninth Governor of Abia State under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. He was also declared the winner of the 2019 gubernatorial election after polling a total number of 261,127 votes to defeat Uche Ogah of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Alex Otti of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA.and sworn in as Governor for a second term on May 29, 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS</h3>\r\n<p>Abia State consists of seventeen (17) Local Government Areas. They are:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Aba North</l1><li>Aba South</l1><li>Arochukwu</l1><li>Bende</l1><li>Ikwuano</l1><li>IsialaNgwa North</l1><li>IsialaNgwa South</l1><li>Isuikwuato</l1><li>Obi Ngwa</l1><li>Ohafia</l1><li>OsisiomaNgwa</l1><li>Ugwunagbo</l1><li>Ukwa East</l1><li>Ukwa West</l1><li>Umuahia North</l1><li>Umuahia South</l1><li>UmuNneochi</li></ul>'),
(2, 'Akwa Ibom', 'assets/img/uploads/states/akwa-ibom-3.jpeg', '<h3>History of Akwa Ibom State </h3>\r\nAkwa Ibom State was created on the 23rd of September 1987 by the then Military Administration of General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe creation of the State brought to fruition years of prolonged struggle by the people that occupied the mainland part of the former Cross River State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor many, the creation of the State was a mark of justice, having been left out in earlier state creation exercises despite leading in the struggle for state creation in Nigeria, through the Ibibio Union, a foremost Socio-Cultural organization that served as a unifying platform for the people in the locality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1948, Ibibio Union, formed in 1928, transformed from a mere cultural association to a goal-driven institution which promoted and championed the cause of state creation in Nigeria.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever, when in 1967 the 12-state structure was established following the creation of states by the General Yakubu Gowon administration, the Mainland part of Calabar Province in the then Eastern Nigeria was merely part of the then South Eastern State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1976, South Eastern State was renamed Cross River State. This change in name did not satisfy the people. Rather, it encouraged them to carry on with the struggle for a state of their own.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter the collapse of the 2nd Republic in 1983, a memorandum demanding the creation of Akwa Ibom State was submitted to the General Buhari Administration by the Paramount Rulers from the 10 Local Government areas that made up the mainland part of the then Cross River State, though it did not yield the desired result.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUndaunted, the people waited for another opportunity. This came when, in 1986, the Administration of General Ibrahim Babangida set up a political Bureau to define the future political direction of the country. The memorandum was re-submitted.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOn September 23, 1987, the collective dream of the people was actualized as Akwa Ibom State, the “Land of Promise” was finally created, after about four decades of sustained agitation.\r\n\r\n<h3>Location</h3>\r\nLying between Latitudes 4o 32” and 5o 33” North and Longitudes 7o 35” and 8o 25” East, the State is bounded on the East by Rivers State, on the West by Cross River State, on the North by Abia State and on the South by the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n\r\n<h3>Area</h3>\r\nAkwa Ibom State currently covers a total land area of 7,249 square kilometers. The area does not take into consideration disputed territories. It is the 10th largest state in Nigeria in terms of landmass. About 13.4 percent of the 960km of Nigeria’s Atlantic Ocean coastline runs through the State. Towns include; Eket, Ikot Ekpene, Ikot Abasi, Oron, Abak, Itu, Etinan, Ibeno, Etinan, Onna, Uyo etc.\r\n\r\n<h3>People</h3>\r\nThe people of Akwa Ibom State are culturally homogenous with a common identity and are reputed to be the first settlers in the present day South Eastern Nigeria. The three major dialectal groups are Ibibio, Annang and Oron. Other sub groups include Eket, Ibeno, Itu Mbonuso and the Andonis. English is the language of government and business.\r\n\r\n<h3>Vegetation</h3>\r\nAkwa Ibom falls within the tropical zone with a dominant vegetation of green foliage of trees and shrubs. It constitutes a major chunk of the nation’s oil-palm belt. The Atlantic coastline stretches 129km from Oron in the East to Ikot Abasi in the West. The State also has three distinct vegetation zones: the saline water swamp forest, the fresh water swamp forest and the rain forest.\r\n\r\n<h3>Culture</h3>\r\nAkwa Ibom is often described as a uni-cultural State where norms, taboos, customs and traditions are the same. The folkways may vary from one ethnic grouping to another, but the operational cultural norms are basically the same all over the State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe cultural similarities bind the people together especially in such areas as cuisines, dressing, dances, songs, rituals, folklores, beliefs and myths. Almost all aspects of its culture have potentials to provide fascinating experiences for tourists and for investment opportunities.\r\n\r\n<h3>Special Dances</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><h4>Asian Ubo Ikpa</h4>\r\nAsian Uboikpa means the proud and flamboyant maiden. This dance is performed by maidens between the ages of 18 years and 25 years who have successfully gone through the ‘Mbopo’ institution. Mbopo being the period a girl is confined, fattened and drilled on all aspects of home management in preparation for marriage.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt is common in almost all the hinterland of the State. Performed by maidens at their prime, Asian Uboikpa therefore is in its visual appeal and celebrates and affirms the youthful innocence and purity in their beauty, while showcasing the popular admonition among the Akwa Ibom people that chastity once lost is lost forever.</li>\r\n<li><h4>\r\n    Oko</h4>\r\nOko is the male dance which is likened to the war dance because of its ferocious displays. The climax of this dance starts when the dancers start slashing at one another with razor sharp machetes and firing at themselves with live bullets from Dane guns.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut mysteriously, not a drop of blood is shed as the machetes cannot penetrate the skin of the dancers, or the bullets hurt any of the members of what is obviously a secret society.</li><li>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Nkerebe</h4>\r\nNkerebe (looking for husband) is another women dance, performed once a year when young girls at the age of puberty prepare to perform the Mboppo ceremony.</li><li>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Asian Mbre Iban</h4>\r\nAsian Mbre Iban are dances performed by maidens who wish to inform unmarried men of the community how beautiful and eligible they are. Other women dances include Akan, Asamba and Uwok which is performed in the villages occasionally.</li><li>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Ndok Ufok Ebe</h4>\r\nThe Ndok Ufok Ebe (shame of a bad marriage) is another women dance to express their grievances over maltreatment of women by their husbands. The dance is performed once a year. It is accompanied by songs telling the community about their plight, often, it involves going topless to the market place.</li><li>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Ebre</h4>\r\nThere is also the Ebre society women dance performed yearly during harvesting of new yam. During this occasion, women dance to the market place and neighbouring villages. The dance is not only meant to entertain but as well as deliberate protest against what is regarded as male chauvinism, which is reflected in the vulgarity of some of the song texts.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>MINERALS RESOURCES </h3>\r\nThe state is endowed with various minerals resources. It is the third largest producer of petroleum in Nigeria. Other, resources include limestone, clay, natural gas, salt, coal, giver nitrate and glass sand. Its soil is host to a number of mineral resources that can be commercially exploited.\r\n\r\n'),
(3, 'Bayelsa', 'assets/img/uploads/states/bayelsa-3.jpeg', '<h3>HISTORY OF BAYELSA STATE</h3>\r\n\r\nBAYELSA State was created on October 1, 1996 out of the old Rivers State by the military government of General Sani Abacha. The name, Bayelsa, is an acronym of three former Local Government areas ‘BRASS, YENAGOA AND SAGBAMA’ in the then Rivers State, which had earlier on comprised the entire area now constituting Bayelsa State. The then Brass LGA is what makes up the present Nembe, Brass and Ogbia Local Government Areas; the then Yenagoa LGA consist of the present Yenagoa, Kolokuma/Opokuma and Southern Ijaw Local Government Areas and the then Sagbama LGA is what makes up the present Sagbama and Ekeremor Local Government Areas.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe tradition in the old Rivers State, which is still the norm in Bayelsa State now, is the use of acronyms for local government areas. People referred to Brass Local Government Area as BALGA, for short; Yenagoa was simply YELGA, while Sagbama was SALGA. Since personalities from BALGA, YELGA, and SALGA made up the State Creation Movement prior to the 1996 exercise, the proposed name agreed upon was BAYELSA.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBayelsa State has one of the largest crude oil and natural gas deposits in Nigeria. As a result petroleum production is extensive in the state. However, the majority of Bayelsans live in poverty. They are mainly rural dwellers due to its peculiar terrain and lack of adequate transportation, health, education or other infrastructure as a result of decades of neglect by the central governments, state and petroleum prospecting companies. This has been a large problem in the state since its creation and successive state governments have not been able to address and repair the issue. The state, as a result, has an almost non-existent commerce. Successive state governments have, however, embarked on various industrial projects (even venturing into the oil and gas sector), and \"poverty-alleviation\" programs to reverse this situation\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe local population engages in fishing on a subsistence and commercial level. The Bayelsa State government is otherwise the main employer of labor in the state.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith its capital is Yenagoa; it is bordered on the west by Rivers State, on the East and South by the Atlantic Ocean and on the North by Delta State. It has a population of 1,703,358 and occupies an area of 10,773 square kilometres. Some major cities include Amassoma, Brass, Ekeremor, Kaiama, Nembe, Odi, Ogbia, Oporama, Otuoke and Sagbama. Bayelsa state was originally part of the Eastern Region in the three-region structure of 1954. It is now situated in the Niger Delta region between Delta State and Rivers State.\r\nOn 20th of December 1999, the state was further subdivided into eight LGAs (Brass, Ekeremor, Kolokuma/Opokuma, Nembe, Ogbia, Sagbama, Southern Ijaw and Yenagoa). Each LGA is the grassroots government and headed by a chairman. \r\nThere are four main languages spoken by the people are Izon, Nembe, Ogbia, and Epie-Atissa. Like the rest of Nigeria, English is the official language.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe predominant religions in the State are Christianity and Traditional worship. Bayelsa State has 24 first class traditional rulers (and many second and third class traditional rulers) recognized by the State Government. Each community of the state has a traditional head while the State Council of Chiefs is headed by the elderly man that is most acceptable.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBayelsa state is home to many landmarks and historical centres. Some of these attractions are The Slave Transit Hall, Akassa, The Oloibiri Oil Museum, The Akassa Raid Graveyard, The War Boat at Aleibiri and Manilla and Bronze heads in the Opokuma forest near Oloibiri.\r\n\r\n<h3>Mineral Resources</h3>\r\nAlthough, Bayelsa State has one of the largest crude oil and natural gas deposits in Nigeria, majority of Bayelsans live in poverty and even petroleum product is expensive. Crude oil is used for making gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, tar, asphalt, paraffin wax, and lubricating oils.\r\n<br><br>\r\nClay - There are many different clay minerals that are used for industrial applications. Clays are used in the manufacturing of paper, refractories, rubber, ball clay, dinnerware and pottery, floor and wall tile, sanitary wear, fire clay, firebricks, foundry sands, drilling mud, iron-ore pelletizing, absorbent and filtering materials, construction materials, and cosmetics.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGypsum (partially investigated): Processed gypsum is used in industrial or building plaster, prefabricated wallboard, cement manufacture, and for agriculture.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLimestone - A sedimentary rock consisting largely of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which have the same composition CaCO3\". Limestone, along with dolomite, is one of the basic building blocks of the construction industry. Limestone is used as aggregate, building stone, cement, and lime and in fluxes, glass, refractories, fillers, abrasives, soil conditioners, and a host of chemical processes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUranium (partially investigated) - Uranium is a radioactive material used in nuclear defense systems and for nuclear generation of electricity. It also used in nuclear-medicine x-ray machines, atomic dating, and electronic instruments.\r\n<br><br>\r\nManganese (partially investigated) - Manganese is essential to iron and steel production. Manganese is obtained from the ore minerals Braunite (Mn,Si)2O3, Pyrolusite MnO2, and Psilomelane BaMn9O18*2H2O.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLignite (partially investigated) - About 79 percent of lignite coal is used to generate electricity, 13.5 percent is used to generate synthetic natural gas. Also, it is used as fuel for steam electric power generation in some countries\r\n<br><br>\r\nLead/Zinc (partially investigated) - Lead is used in batteries, construction, ammunition, television tubes, nuclear shielding, ceramics, weights, and tubes or containers. The United States is largest producer (mainly from Missouri), consumer, and recycler of lead metal.\r\n\r\n<h3>Notable Bayelsans</h3>\r\n    <ul><li>Gabriel Okara, novelist and poet\r\n    </li><li>Ernest Ikoli, pioneering Nigerian journalist and pre-independent freedom fighter\r\n    </li><li>Major Isaac Adaka Boro, Nigerian Civil War hero (Nigerian Army)\r\n    </li><li>Daniel Igali, Canadian Olympic gold medalist and world wrestling champion\r\n    </li><li>Alfred Diete-Spiff, former governor of Rivers State, HRM\r\n    </li><li>Edmund Daukoru, past Nigerian Minister of State for Energy and was Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2006, HRM\r\n    </li><li>Melford Obiene Okilo, former governor of Rivers State\r\n    </li><li>Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, first executive governor of Bayelsa State]\r\n    </li><li>Goodluck Jonathan, past president of Nigeria\r\n    </li><li>Timipre Sylva, former governor of Bayelsa state\r\n    </li><li>Timaya, musical artist\r\n    </li><li>Timi Dakolo, musical artist\r\n    </li><li>Samson Siasia, Former Super Eagles player and Coach\r\n    </li><li>Diezani Alison-Madueke, Former Minister of Solid Minerals, Transport and Petroleum resources\r\n    </li><li>Dan Etete Former Minister Minister Petroleum resources\r\n    </li><li>Finidi George, Former Super Eagles player\r\n    </li><li>Heineken Lokpobiri Minister of State for Agriculture\r\n    </li><li>Owoye Andrew Azazi former Chief of Army Staff (Nigeria), former Chief of Defense Staff under President Olusegun Obasanjo and former National Security Adviser under President Goodluck Jonathan.</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Education</h3>\r\nThe major tertiary institutions in Bayelsa state are: \r\n    <ul><li>Niger Delta University\r\n    </li><li>Isaac Jasper Boro College of Education\r\n    </li><li>College of Health Sciences\r\n    </li><li>School of Nursing\r\n    </li><li>Bayelsa State College of Arts and Science\r\n    </li><li>Bayelsa Medical University\r\n    </li><li>University of Africa\r\n    </li><li>Federal Polytechnic Ekeowe\r\n    </li><li>International Institute of Tourism\r\n    </li><li>Federal University Otuoke</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Administrators and Governors</h3>\r\nThe list of administrators and Governors of Bayelsa State since 1996 include: Phillip Ayeni,\r\nHabu Daura, Omoniyi Caleb Olubolade and Paul Obi as military administrators between 7 October 1996 and 29 May 1999.

(4, 'Benue', 'assets/img/uploads/states/benue-3.jpeg', '<h3>HISTORY OF BENUE STATE</h3>\r\nBenue State is one of the states in the North Central area of Nigeria. Its capital is Makurdi. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBenue State as it exists today is a surviving legacy of an administrative entity which was carved out of the protectorate of Northern Nigeria at the beginning of the twentieth century. The territory was initially known as Munshi Province until 1918 when the name of its dominant geographical feature, the \'Benue River\' was adopted.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBenue State is named after the Benue River and was formed from the former Benue-Plateau State in 1976, along with Igala and some parts of Kwara State. In 1991 some areas of Benue state (mostly Igala area), along with areas in Kwara State, were carved out to become part of the new Kogi State. Igbo people are found in the boundary areas like the Obi, Oju etc.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSamuel Ortom is the governor and Benson Abounu is the deputy governor. Both were elected under the All Progressives Congress (APC) but defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2018. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBenue State has three universities: Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State University, Makurdi, University of Mkar. It has two polytechnics: Benue State Polytechnic, Ugbokolo and Fidei polytechnic, Gboko as well as the Akperan Orshi College of Agriculture Yandev. There are about four colleges of education which are Federal College of Education Agasha, College of Education Oju and College of Education Kastina Ala.\r\n\r\n<h3>Population structure and distribution</h3>\r\nThe State, which is located in the North Central region of Nigeria, has a total population of 4,253,641 in 2006 census, with an average population density of 99 persons per km2. This makes Benue the 9th most populous state in Nigeria. However, the distribution of the population according to Local government areas shows marked duality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are areas of low population density. such as Guma, Gwer East, Ohimini, Katsina-Ala, Apa, Logo and Agatu, each with less than seventy persons per km2, while Vandeikya, Okpokwu, Ogbadibo, Obi and Gboko have densities ranging from 160 persons to 200 persons per 2 . Makurdi LGA has over 380 person per km2. The males are 49.8 percent of the total population while females constitute 50.2 per cent.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMakurdi doubles as the capital of the state and the headquarters of Makurdi LGA, while Gboko, Otukpo and Oju double as the local government and ethnic headquarters (i.e. for Tiv, Idoma, and Igede). \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Benue State of today has twenty-three (23) local government areas, which are administered by local government councils.\r\n\r\n<h3>Geology and environment</h3>\r\nBenue State lies within the lower river Benue trough in the middle belt region of Nigeria. Its geographic coordinates are longitude 7° 47\' and 10° 0\' East. Latitude 6° 25\' and 8° 8\' North; and shares boundaries with five other states namely: Nasarawa State to the north, Taraba State to the east, Cross-River State to the south, Enugu State to the south-west and Kogi State to the west. The state also shares a common boundary with the Republic of Cameroon on the south-east. Benue occupies a landmass of 34,059 square kilometres.\r\n\r\n<h3>Geology</h3>\r\nBased on Köppen climate classification, Benue State lies within the AW climate and experiences two distinct seasons, the Wet season and the Dry season. The rainy season lasts from April to October with annual rainfall in the range of 100-200mm. The dry season begins in November and ends in March. Temperatures fluctuate between 21 – 37 degrees Celsius in the year. The south-eastern part of the state adjoining the Obudu-Cameroun mountain range, however, has a cooler climate similar to that of Plateau State.\r\n\r\n<h3>Mineral resources</h3>\r\nBenue State is blessed with abundant mineral resources. These resources are distributed in the Local Government Areas of the state. Of these mineral resources, only Limestone at Tse-Kucha near Gboko and Kaolinite at Otukpo are being commercially exploited .\r\n<br><br>\r\nOther mineral deposits include Baryte, Gypsum, Feldspar, Wolframite, Kaolinite, mineral salts and Gemstone etc.\r\n\r\n<h3>Natural resources</h3>\r\nBenue State is the nation\'s acclaimed food basket because of its rich agricultural produce which include Yam, Rice, Beans, Cassava, Sweet-potato, Maize, Soybean, Sorghum, Millet, Sesame, cocoyam etc. The state accounts for over 70% of Nigeria\'s Soybean production.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the economy, engaging over 75% of the state farming population. The State also boasts of one of the longest stretches of river systems in the country with great potential for a viable fishing industry, dry season farming through irrigation and for an inland water highway.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe vegetation of the southern parts of the state is characterized by forests, which yield trees for timber and provide a suitable habitat for rare animals types and species. The state thus possesses potential for the development of viable forest and wildlife reserves.\r\n\r\n<h3>Relief and drainage</h3>\r\nThe land is generally low lying (averaging 100m-250m) and gently undulating with occasional inselbergs, Knoll, Laterite etc. It is only at the boundary area with Cameroon, also Kwande and Oju Local Government Areas that hilly terrain with appreciable local relief is encountered. Here, the terrain is characterized by steep slopes, deep incised valleys and generally rugged relief. Elsewhere, gradients average less than 4°. River Benue is the dominant geographical feature in the state. It is one of the few large rivers in Nigeria. The Katsina-Ala is the largest tributary, while the smaller rivers include Mkomon, Amile, Duru, LokoKonshisha, Kpa, Okpokwu, Mu, Be, Aya, ApaOgede and Ombi. The flood plains which are characterized by extensive swamps and ponds are good for dry season irrigated farming.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThough Benue State has high drainage density many of the streams are seasonal. Hence, there is an acute water shortage in the dry season in Local Government Areas such as Guma, Okpokwu, Ogbadibo, Gwer West (Naka, Nigeria) and Oju.\r\n\r\n<h3>People and culture</h3>\r\nThe state is populated by several ethnic groups: Tiv, Idoma, Igede, Etulo, Abakpa, Jukun, Hausa, Igbo, Akweya and Nyifon. The Tiv are occupying 14 local government areas with the Etulo and Jukun, with the Idoma, Igede, Igbo, Akweya and Nyifon occupying nine.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMost of the people Tiv are farmers while the inhabitants of the river areas engage in fishing as their primary or important secondary occupation. The people of the state are famous for their cheerful and hospitable disposition as well as rich cultural heritage.\r\n\r\n<h3>Traditional rulers</h3>\r\nThe Benue State Government accords high respect to traditional rulers in recognition of their role as custodians of culture and as agents of development. Also, their roles in enhancing peace and order at the grassroots level are also recognised. To enhance their contribution to the affairs of the state, government has established a three-tier traditional council system made up of Local Government Area Traditional Councils, Area Traditional Councils and the State Council of Chiefs with the Tor Tiv (Tiv King) as chairman.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe two Area Councils are the Tiv Traditional Council and the Idoma Traditional Council. The former has the Tor Tiv (Tiv King) as chairman of all the traditional rulers from the Tiv dominant Local Government Areas, while the latter has the Och\' Idoma (Idoma king) as the chairman of all the traditional rulers from the Idoma dominant Local Government Areas.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe State Council of Chiefs had the Tor Tiv, Orchivirigh Professor James Ortese Iorzua Ayatse (Tor Tiv V)), with Och\'Idoma and all second class Chiefs/Chairmen of the Local Government Traditional Council as members.\r\n\r\n<h3>Culture</h3>\r\nBenue State possesses a rich and diverse cultural heritage which finds expression in colourful cloths, exotic masquerades, supplicated music and dances. Traditional dances from Benue State have won acclaim at national and international cultural festivals. The most popular of these dances include Ingyough, Ange, Anchan-akupa, Swange and Ogirinya among others.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe socio-religious festivals of the people, colourful dances, dresses and songs are also of tourist value. The Alekwu ancestral festival of the Idoma people, for instance, is an occasion when the local people believe their ancestors re-established contact with the living in the form of masquerades.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe lgede-Agba is a Yam Festival, marked every year in September by the lgede people of Oju and Obi local government areas. Among the Tiv, the Tiv Day, marriage ceremonies and dance competitions (e.g. Swange dance) are often very colourful. Kwagh-Hir is a very entertaining Tiv puppet show.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSocial life in Benue State is also enriched by the availability of diverse recreational facilities. Apart from parks, beaches, dancing and masquerades mentioned above, the big hotels in Makurdi, Gboko and Otukpo are equipped with several indoor sporting facilities. There are golf clubs, the Makurdi Club, Railway Club, Police Club and Air Force Club, where, apart from the sale of drinks and snacks, various types of games are played.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is a standard Arts Theatre, a modern Sports Complex which includes the AperAku Stadium, which has provisions for such games as tennis, basketball, volleyball and handball, an indoor sports hall and Olympic size swimming pool in Makurdi. A Smaller stadia exist in Gboko (J. S. Tarka Stadium), Katsina-Ala, Adikpo, Vandeikya and Otukpo. The BCC Lawn Tennis tournament attracts players from all over the country. Benue State has three teams in the professional soccer ranks, Lobi Stars F.C. in Division One, BCC Lions FC in Division Two, Mark mentors as the basketball premier league team.\r\n\r\n<h3>Economy</h3>\r\n    • Agricultural production\r\nAgriculture forms the backbone of the Benue State economy, engaging more than 70 per cent of the working population. This has made Benue the major source of food production in the Nation. It can still be developed because most of the modern techniques are not yet popular to 98% of Nigeria. Mechanization and plantation agriculture/agro-forestry are still at its infancy. Farm inputs such as fertilizers, improved seed, insecticides and other foreign methods are being increasingly used. However, cost and availability is still a challenge. Important cash crops include soybeans, rice, peanuts, mango varieties, citrus, etc.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOther cash crops include palm oil, melon, African pear, chili pepper, tomatoes etc. Food crops include Yam, Cassava, Sweet potato, Beans, Maize, Millet, Guinea corn, Vegetables etc. There is very little irrigation agriculture and techniques.\r\nAnimal production include, Cattle, Pork, Poultry and Goat but no dairy and dairy products yet.\r\n\r\n<h3>Education</h3>\r\nThere are three universities recognized by the National Universities Commission in Benue State namely; Joseph SaarwuanTarkaa University of Agriculture, Makurdi; Benue State University and University of Makurdi.'),

Located in the Niger Delta, it occupies 20,156 square kilometers. It shares boundaries with Benue State to the north, Enugu and Abia States to the west, to the east by Cameroon Republic and to the south by Akwa-Ibom and the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDuring the European scramble for Africa, Queen Victoria signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to Europeans as Old Calabar on 10 September 1884. This enabled the United Kingdom to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi. The territory subsequently became de facto part of the Nigeria, although the border was never permanently delineated. However, documents released by the Cameroonians, in parity with that of the British and Germans, clearly places Bakassi under Cameroonian Territory as a consequence of colonial era Anglo-German agreements.\r\n\r\n<h3>Government</h3>\r\nCross River State was created on May 27, 1967 from the former Eastern Region, Nigeria by the General Yakubu Gowon regime. Its name was changed to Cross River State in the 1976 state creation exercise by the then General Murtala Mohammed regime from South Eastern State. The present day Akwa Ibom State was excised from it in the state creation exercise of September 1987 by the then regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. Its capital is Calabar. Its major towns are Akamkpa, Biase, Calabar South, Ikom, Obubra, Odukpani, Ogoja, Ugep, Obudu, Obanliku and Akpabuyo.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe state has been previously governed by many governors and administrators including Udoakaha J. Esuene, Paul Omu, Tunde Elegbede, Clement Isong, Donald Etiebet, Daniel Archibong, Ibim Princewill, Ernest Atta, Clement Ebri, Ibrahim Kefas, Gregory Agboneni, Umar Faoruk Ahmed, Christopher Osondu, Donald Duke and Liyel Imoke. The current Governor, Professor Ben Ayade is running his second term in office.\r\n\r\n<h3>People & Culture </h3>\r\nThe state has an estimated population of about 2.89 million people (2006) who have a rich and unique cultural heritage. Ejagham and Efik are major languages of this state, but the Igbo tribe and language are also present in its western land borders. Forty percent of the estimated population constitutes the active population that is engaged in various economic activities; ranging from subsistence agriculture to urban commerce and transport business.\r\n\r\n<h3>Geography</h3>\r\nThe state has a catchment area of 53,590 sq. km, and delivers more sediment load to the coast, than the present Niger Benue drainage system. The Niger delta shoreline is therefore undergoing erosion on account of sedi ment starvation. The strength of the Cross River deltaic sedimentation derives from the Cameroun Mountain which is the most active sediment source area along the West African coast. Cross River State map\r\n\r\n<h3>Weather/Climate</h3>\r\nCross River State belongs to tropical rainfall belt where rainfall is usually seasonal and at times very heavy. Humid tropical climate of about 1300 3000mm rain fall and 30°C mean annual temperatures prevail over Cross River State, except on the Obudu Plateau, where the climate is subtemperate, with temperatures of 15°C 23°C. The vegetation ranges from mangrove swamps, through rainforest, to derived savannah, and montane parkland. Just as its rocks are diverse, so also are the mineral resource potentials of the State.\r\n\r\n<h3>Demographics</h3>\r\n\r\nThe State is composed of three major ethnic groups: the Efik, the Ejagham, and the Bekwarra. The Efik language is widely spoken in Cross River State, and as far as Arochukwu in neighboring Abia state.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Efik-speaking people live mainly in the Southern senetorial districts of Cross River, or as it is commonly referred to, the Greater Calabar district, which includes Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Bakassi, Biase, Akpabuyo, Odukpani, and Akamkpa LGAs. There is also the Qua community in Calabar, which speaks Ejagham. The main Ejagham group occupies mostly the Greater Calabar areas of Calabar Municipality, Odukpani, Biase and Akampkpa sections of Cross River State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are also the Yakurr/Agoi/Bahumono ethnic groups in Yakurr and Abi LGA, while the Mbembe are predominantly found in Obubra LGA. Further up the core northern part of the state are several sub-dialectical groups, among which are Etung, Olulumo, Ofutop, Nkim/Nkum, Abanajum, Nseke and Boki in both Ikom, Etung and Boki LGAs. Also, the Yala/Yache,Igede, Ukelle, Ekajuka, Mbube, Bette, Bekwarra and Utugwanga people are found in Ogoja, Yala, Obudu and Obanliku LGA’s. The Yala are a subgroup of the Idoma nation, part of the Yala LGA’s subgroups are the Igede speaking people believed to have migrated from the Oju part of Benue State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCross River State epitomises the nation’s linguistic and cultural plurality and it is important to note that, in spite of the diversity of dialects, all the indigenous languages in the state have common linguistic roots as Niger–Congo languages. Finally, the state boasts of being the venue for the largest carnival in Africa.\r\n\r\n<h3>Local Government Areas</h3>\r\nCross River State consists of eighteen (18) Local Government Areas. They are:         Abi, Akamkpa, Akpabuyo, Bakassi, Bekwarra, Biase Boki, Calabar Municipal, Calabar South, Etung, Ikom, Obanliku, Obubra, Obudu, Odukpani, Ogoja, Yakuur and Yala.\r\n\r\n<h3>Festivals</h3>\r\nIn line with the objectives of the state government to mix business with pleasure, there are many festivals. These festivals bring in tourists from far and wide into the state to enjoy themselves and also do business in the state. These festivals include The Cross River State Christmas Festival– 1 December to 31 December annually; The Cross River State Carnival Float – 26th and 27th December yearly; The Yakurr Leboku Yam festival – 28 August annually and The Calabar Boat Regata,aside other Interesting festivals like  Anong Bahumono Festival which holds in Anong Village, during which different cultural dances are showcased, including Ikpobin (acclaimed to be the most entertaining dance in the state), Ekoi, Obam, Emukei and Etangala Dances.\r\n\r\n<h3>Tourism in Cross River State</h3>\r\nFrom the soaring plateaus of the mountain tops of Obanliku to the Rain forests of Afi, from the Waterfalls of Agbokim and Kwa to the spiralling ox-bow Calabar River which provides sights and images of the Tinapa Business Resort, Calabar Marina, Calabar Residency Museum and the Calabar Slave Park along its course, there is always a thrilling adventure awaiting the eco-tourist visiting Cross River State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOther tourist attractions are the Ikom Monoliths (a series of volcanic-stone monoliths of unknown age), the Mary Slessor Tomb, Calabar Drill Monkey Sanctuary, Cross River National Park, Afi Mountain walkway canopy, Kwa falls, Agbokim waterfalls, Tinapa Business Resort and the annual Calabar Carnival that takes place during the Christmas period.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCross River State can be accessed by air through the Margaret Ekpo International Airport at Calabar. There are daily flights to Calabar from Lagos and Abuja serviced by airlines such as Virgin Nigeria, Arik Airlines and Aero Contractors. Aero Contractors also have flights to the Bebi airstrip at Obanliku for trips to the Obanliku Mountain Resort.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCalabar, the capital of Cross River State, is now the leading tourism city of Nigeria[citation needed]. Visitors from different parts of Nigeria come to the city in large numbers all year around.\r\n\r\n<h3>Education</h3>\r\nTertiary educational institutions are the University of Calabar and the Cross River State University of Technology both in Calabar, the Ibrahim Babangida College of Agriculture in Obubra and The Polytechnic, Calabar.'),

It became an autonomous entity on August 27, 1991 after having been part of the old Midwestern State (1963-1976) and the defunct Bendel State (1976-1991).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt was created from the then Bendel State on 27th August 1991 by the then regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. Delta State is named after the delta region of the River Niger. Asaba, located at the northern end of the state, is the capital.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWarri is the biggest commercial city in the state. Other major towns are Agbor, Ughelli, Oleh, Ozoro, Oghara, Sapele, Koko, Burutu, Okpanam and Ogwashi-ukwu. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDelta State started with twelve local government areas. These were split further into nineteen local governments on September 27, 1991, and to twenty five LGAs in 1997. A master plan for Asaba Capital Territory, with an estimated area of 762 sq. km and designed to transform Asaba into a modern metropolis, is being pursued by the state government.\r\n\r\n<h3>Location</h3>\r\nDelta State lies roughly between longitudes 5°00 and 6°45\'E and latitudes 5°00 and 6°30\'N.

These groups share ancestral and traditional administrative systems, evident in their dress, language, festivals, music and folklore. The people are hospitable, enlightened, resourceful and hardworking.\r\n\r\n<h3>Weather/Climate</h3>\r\nDelta State is situated in the tropics and therefore experiences a fluctuating climate, ranging from the humid tropical in the south, to the sub-humid in the northeast. The lessening of humidity towards the north is accompanied by an increasingly marked dry season. The average rainfall is about 266.5mm in the coastal areas and 190.5mm in the extreme north. Rainfall is heaviest in July. Temperature increases from the south to the north. In Warri, located in the south for example, the average daily temperature is 30°C, while the temperature in Asaba in the north eastern area is 44°C.\r\n\r\n<h3>Natural resources</h3>\r\nThere are various solid mineral deposits within state – Crude oil, industrial clay, silica, lignite, kaolin, tar sand, decorative rocks, limestone, etc. These are raw materials for industries such as brickmaking, ceramics, bottle manufacturing, glass manufacturing, chemical/insulators production, chalk manufacturing and sanitary wares, decorative stone cutting and quarrying.'),

It is located in South Eastern Nigeria. The city had a population of 722,664 according to the 2006 Nigerian census. The name Enugu is derived from the two Igbo words ÉnúỤ́gwụ́ meaning \"hill top\" denoting the city\'s hilly geography. The city was named after EnugwuNgwo, under which coal was found.\r\nSince the 17th century the location of present-day Enugu has been inhabited by the Nike (/niːˈkeɪ/ nee-KAY) subgroup of the Igbo people; one of Enugu\'s neighbourhoods still retains the village\'s old name Ogui. In 1900 the Southern Nigeria Protectorate was established by the colonial administration of the British Empire. The discovery of coal by the colonialists led to the building of the Eastern Line railway to carry coal from the inland city to the port of Port Harcourt, a city created for this purpose located 151 miles (243 km) south[11] of what was called Enugu Coal Camp. Enugu was then renamed simply Enugu and developed as one of the few cities in West Africa created from European contact. By 1958 Enugu had over 8,000 coal miners. <br><br>\r\nEnugu became the capital of the Eastern Region after Nigeria\'s independence in 1960; a succession of territorial adjustments in 1967, 1976 and 1991 led to Enugu becoming the capital of what is now Enugu State. On 30 May 1967 Enugu was declared the capital of the short-lived Republic of Biafra; for this Enugu is known as the \"capital of Igboland.\" After Enugu was captured by the Nigerian armed forces, the Biafran capital was moved to Umuahia.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIndustries in the city include the urban market and bottling industries. Enugu is also one of the filming locations for directors of the Nigerian movie industry, dubbed \"Nollywood\". Enugu\'s main airport is the AkanuIbiam International Airport. The main educational establishment in the city is the Enugu campus of the University of Nigeria based in Nsukka, a town north of Enugu and in the same state.\r\n\r\n<h3>Early History</h3>\r\nThe first settlement in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui, which was present since the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Nike in the Igbo language means \"with strength or power.\" It was through slave raiding that the Nike people acquired most of their lands, which were mostly unsettled. The Nike used slaves for a defence strategy, placing slave camps at the edge of their territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free born. The Nike people were allied to the Aro people who formed the Aro Confederacy (1690—1901) which was an Igbo organisation that controlled slave trading in the Enugu area.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAlong with the Aro people who came to trade from Arochukwu in the south were the Hausa people who came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike which were used for rituals by the Igbo. Both the Aro and Hausa migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu and were considered foreigners to the area.\r\n\r\n<h3>Climate</h3>\r\nEnugu is located in a tropical rain forest zone with a derived savannah. The city has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw). Enugu\'s climate is humid and this humidity is at its highest between March and November. For the whole of Enugu State the mean daily temperature is 26.7 °C (80.1 °F). As in the rest of West Africa, the rainy season and dry season are the only weather periods that recurs in Enugu. The average annual rainfall in Enugu is around 2,000 millimetres (79 in), which arrives intermittently and becomes very heavy during the rainy season. Other weather conditions affecting the city include Harmattan, a dusty trade wind lasting a few weeks of December and January. Like the rest of Nigeria, Enugu is hot all year round.\r\n\r\n<h3>CULTURE</h3>\r\nTwo important Igbo traditional festivals take place in Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that each has a name. This festival is held as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it is supported by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture.<br><br>\r\nThe second important Igbo festival, the New yam festival known as \'iwa ji\', is held between August and October marking the harvesting and feasting of the new yam. The yam is a root vegetable that is the staple crop and a cultural symbol for the Igbo people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRecently created festivals include the Enugu Festival of Arts which is managed by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The festival highlights African culture and traditions and it is here that the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture included the Mmanwu parade as part of the events. The Enugu Festival of Arts was started in 1986; it has modernised the Mmanwu festival by transferring it from its traditional village surroundings to the urban setting of Enugu.\r\nDiana, Princess of Wales was a notable spectator of Enugu\'s cultural shows when she visited the city in 1990. \r\n\r\n<h3>TOURISM</h3>\r\nThe tourism industry in Enugu, managed by the Enugu State Tourism Board (ESTB), is small; however, the state government recognizes a variety of historic and recreational sites. These sites include places like the Udi Hills, from which the majority of Enugu city can be viewed. The Polo amusement park is a funfair that is among the first generation of public parks in the state. Other parks include the Murtala Muhammed Park. Enugu\'s former coal mines, Onyeama and Okpara, are open to public visits. Some other spots include: The Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Sculptural Garden and Art Gallery, the Eastern Region Parliamentary Building, the Old Government Lodge, and Enugu Golf course. Enugu Zoo is another attraction - it is divided into the botanical garden and the zoological section. A National Museum is located near Enugu at its north, although it receives few visitors. It is managed by National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM). Other galleries include the Bona Gallery. \r\n\r\n<h3>EDUCATION</h3>\r\nEnugu State has three main tertiary institutions: the Enugu State University of Science & Technology (ESUT); the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Campus (UNN) and Enugu Campus (UNEC); and the Institute of Management & Technology (IMT). Another notable tertiary institution in Enugu State is the Federal Cooperative College, Oji River (FCCO). The city is also home to Our Saviour Institute of Science and Technology, a polytechnic. Some notable secondary schools in Enugu include the College of the Immaculate Conception (CIC) built in 1940, Holy Rosary College (HRC) built in 1943, Colliery Comprehensive Secondary school, Queen\'s Secondary School, Federal Government College, Royal Crown Academy, Nsukka and the University of Nigeria Secondary School.

During the Colonial period, Britain signed many treaties of protection with the chiefs of many coastal communities.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSome of these chiefs had hoped that with Nigeria’s independence, the treaties of protection they signed with Britain would also lapse and thus, they would become independent states. The 1958 constitutional conference which affirmed Nigerian nationhood dashed such hope, but agreed on some measures to allay the fears of the ethnic minorities in this area.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBetween 1941 and 1952, an organization known as the ljo Rivers People’s League had agitated for the creation of a distinct Rivers Province. In 1953, another body called the Council of Rivers Chiefs replaced the League and became the Rivers Chiefs and Peoples’ Congress in 1954, and the Rivers Chiefs Peoples Conference in 1956. The leaders of this organization cooperated with the Calabar Ogoja Rivers (COR) State Movement formed in Uyo in December 1953, but later broke away to press their own case before the Willink Commission.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo allay the fears of the minorities under the dominant ethnic groups within the Nigerian nationhood, the British made one important concession by setting up a Commission headed by Sir Henry Willink to look into the misgivings of the ethnic minorities. The Willink Commission recommended the establishment of the Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB) to address the problem of underdevelopment of the area.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNDDB did not meet the aspirations of the people and thus, some people attempted to take the extralegal route to achieve their goal. In February 1966, Isaac Boro, Sam Owonaro and Nottingham Dick with their supporters proclaimed a “Delta Peoples Republic.” Federal and Eastern Nigeria Governments brought this rebellion to an abrupt end. On May 27, 1967, Rivers State was among the twelve States created by the Gowon Regime (Salawu, 1993).\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe cries of political marginalization, environmental degradation and economic pauperization continued among the ljaws, such that the Old ljaw province was carved out of Rivers State as a distinct Bayelsa State in 1996 by the Abacha led military government of Nigeria.\r\n\r\n<h3>Administrative Areas</h3>\r\nAs at 1967 when Rivers State was created, there were fifteen Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the State and when Bayelsa State was carved out in 1996, additional LGAs were created such that the present Rivers State is made up of twenty three LGAs. The State has many communities that organize community development efforts aimed at mobilizing the local resources and assisting the State government in the maintenance of law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Administrative Structure</h3>\r\nThere are three arms of government in Rivers State and these are: The Executive Council; The Legislature; and The Judiciary. The State Executive Council is made up of the Governor, the Deputy Governor, and twelve com missioners, special advisers and the Secretary to the State government. The commissioners are the overall heads of the ministries, while the permanent secretaries oversee the day-to-day activities of the same ministries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe parastatals are organs of the government charged for the establishment and running of certain key economic areas of the State government. They are placed either under the supervision of the Governor or the Deputy Governor. The special advisers are assigned responsibilities in the following areas to enhance productivity and accountability: education, information, hotels and tourism et cetera.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Rivers State House of Assembly is the legislative (lawmaking) arm of the government. The twenty three member House of Assembly was inaugurated in June 1999, with the Speaker of the House as chairman in all the proceedings. The judiciary is the body that interprets the law in the State. It is headed by the State Chief Justice. The second tier of government is the local government administration. This is the grassroots government that is closest to the people of the State. There are twenty-three local government councils and each is run by its executive council and legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Geology</h3>\r\nRivers State lies on the recent coastal plain of the eastern Niger Delta. Its surface geology consists of fluvial sediments. This includes the recent sediments transported by Niger River distributaries and other rivers, such as Andoni, Bonny and New Calabar. These materials deposited as regolith overburden of 30m thickness are clays, peat, silts, sands and gravels.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe depositional sequence exhibits massive continental sand stones overlying an alternation of sandstones and clays of marginally marine origin, but eventually grading downwards into marine clays. Sands, by far, form the largest group of rock types in Rivers State, while mud constitutes all the polluted brackish waters of the riverine areas. However, peat constitutes the various vegetal and animal remains that lie in bogs and shallow pits. The gravel and pebbles form the last unit of the subsurface rock type, and are usually found at the base of the river channels.\r\n\r\n<h3>Relief</h3>\r\nThe land surface or Rivers State can be grouped into three main divisions: the fresh water, the mangrove swamps of AkukuToru, Abualdual, Asari Toru, Degema, Okrika, Ogu Bolo, Bonny, Andoni and Opobo Local Government Areas; and the Coastal Sand ridges zone. The freshwater zone is the plain that extends north wards from the mangrove swamps. This land surface is generally less than 20m above sea level.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis lower Niger floodplain has a greater silt and clay foundation and is more susceptible to perennial inundation by river floods. The value of the mean thickness appreciates upward to about 45 m in the northeast and over 9m in the beach ridge barrier zones to the southwest. The flood plain is a geomorphic structure whose trends west wards and southwards are broken in many places by small hogback ridges and shallow swamp basins (Aisuebeogun, 1995). The southern part is affected by great tidal influence.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMost water channels in the freshwater zone are bordered by natural levees, which are of great topographical interest and of great economic importance to the local people for settlements and crop cultivation. The upland is undulating to the hinterland and attains a maximum height of 30m above sea level at Okubie, to the southwest. The narrow strip of sandy ridges and beach ridges lie very close to the open sea.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe soils of the sandy ridges are mostly sandy or sandy loams and supports crops like coconut, oil palm, raffia palm and cocoyam. Fourteen of the twenty three LGAs of the State are located on the upland with varying heights between thirteen to 45m above sea level. These include Ogoni, lkwerre LGAs, Ahoada, Abual/Odual, 0gba/ Egbema/Ndoni LGAs and Port Harcourt LGAs. The drier upland area of Rivers State covers about sixty one percent while riverine area, with a relief range of 2m to 5m, covers about thirty nine per cent of the State. The entire topography of the State is also characterized by a maze of effluents, rivers, lakes, creeks, lagoons and swamps crisscrossing the low lying plains in varying dimensions.\r\n\r\n<h3>Drainage</h3>\r\nDrainage is poor, being low lying, with much surface water and a high rainfall, of between 3,420 mm and 7,300 mm.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThus, almost all riverine LGAs are under water at one time of the year or another. Again, some areas of the State are tidally flooded, while others are seasonally, thus limiting agricultural practices and nucleated/urban settlement development that would have enhanced social welfare facility provision. The State is drained by two main river systems, i.e. freshwater systems whose waters originate either outside or wholly within the coastal lowlands, and tidal systems confined largely to the lower half of the State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDrainage densities of rivers within the state have typical value of 1.5 km and sinuosity ratios are in excess of 1.9, indicating that the meandering channels are tortuous. These systems have a general downstream increase in width and velocity, especially in the freshwater zones. The State is drained by the Bonny New Calabar river systems and by a maze of effluent creeks and streams. River bank levees are prominent and valley side slopes are very gentle and experience a great deal of erosion and accretion. All the rivers enter into the sea through wide estuaries.\r\n\r\n<h3>Soils</h3>\r\nThere are three major soil groups in Rivers State, namely: the marine and fluvial marine sediments; the mangrove swamp alluvial soils; and freshwater brown loams and sandy loams. The marine and fluvial marine sediments are found in the wet coastal region. The soils are organic in nature and essentially sandy in texture.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSome consist of mud mixed with decayed organic matter. The mangrove swamp alluvial soils are found in the northern part of the coastal sediments zone. They are brownish on the surface, sometimes with an unpleasant and offensive odour. The soils of the swamps are rich in organic matter in the top layer, but contain too much salt especially in the dry season.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe third soil group, the brown loams and sandy loams are found in the fresh water zone of the delta. The levees which form the common land forms of this zone are made up of rich loams at their crests, changing to more acidic and more clayed soils along their slopes.\r\n\r\n<h3>Climate</h3>\r\nRainfall in Rivers State is seasonal, variable, and heavy. Generally, south of latitude 05Â°N, rain occurs, on the average, every month of the year, but with varying duration. The State is characterized by high rainfall, which decreases from south to north. Total annual rainfall decreases from about 4,700 mm on the coast to about 1,700 mm in extreme north of the State. It is 4,698 mm at Bonny along the coast and 1,862 mm at Degema.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRainfall is adequate for all year round crop production in the State. The duration of the wet season is not less than 330 days, of which a great number is rainy days (days with 250 mm or more of rain). For Port Harcourt, the rainy days are about 182. Mean maximum monthly temperatures range from 28°C to 33°C, while the mean minimum monthly temperatures are in the range of 17°C to 24°C.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe mean monthly temperature is in the range of 25°C to 28°C. The mean annual temperature for the State is 26°C. The hottest months are February to May. The difference between the dry season and wet season temperatures is only about 2°C. Relative humidity is high in the State throughout the year and decreases slightly in the dry season (Salawu 1993).\r\n\r\n<h3>Vegetation</h3>\r\nThe “upland” area was originally occupied by rainforest which has been drastically modified by human activities. In most places, economic trees, particularly oil palm, have been preserved and thus the sobriquet for this vegetation as “oil palm bush.” The riverine area is divisible into three main hydro vegetation zones namely, the beach ridge zone, the saltwater zone and the freshwater zone.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe beach ridge zone is vegetated mainly by fresh water swamp trees, palms and shrubs on the sandy ridges and mangroves in the intervening valleys or tidal flats. The saltwater zone is the tidal flat or swamps vegetated by the red stilts rooted mangrove (Flhizophora racemosa) and two other species of mangrove.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe outliers of raised alluvial ground or coastal plain terrace within the swamps are vege tated by tall forest tree species and oil palm. The freshwater zone is mainly the Upper and Lower Delta flood plains of the Niger, having fresh water forest trees which are the edaphic variants of the rainforest. The Abura tree, oil palm, raffia palm, shrubs, lianas, ferns and floating grasses and reeds are the typical vegetation.\r\n\r\n<h3>Ecological Problems</h3>\r\nDeforestation is among the ecological problems confronting the State, as mass deforestation of both mangrove and rain forest is extensive. In fact, in some parts of the State, derived Savannah exists. Rivers State is a State of physical difficulties, such as low lying terrain riddled with an intricate system of natural water channels; too much surface water and a high rainfall; uninhabitable mangrove swamps and some parts of the state suffer from inaccessibility.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe character of Rivers State relief, drainage and geology poses much problem to resource exploitation and economic development. Other ecological problems include severe beach erosion associated with sea level rise due to global climatic change; annual inundation by river floods; salty soils especially in the dry season; too much leaching of soil fertility due to excessive rainfall; and susceptibility of settle merit sites along the creeks to creek erosion.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOil spills and gas flares with associated thermal, air, water surface and aquifer pollution, caused by oil exploration and production, are taking a toll on the agricultural output of the land, fisheries, vegetation and wildlife.\r\n\r\n<h3>PEOPLE, POPULATION AND SETTLEMENT</h3>\r\n\r\nEthnic Composition, Languages, Culture and the Arts\r\nThe ethnic composition of Rivers State is very diverse. These include Kalahari, lkwerre, Okrika, lbani (Bonny and Opobo) Ekpeye, Ogba, Etche, Khana, Gokana, Eleme, Ndoni, Abua, Odual. Linguistic scholars have grouped these communities into six major linguistic groups, namely ljoid, lower Niger (lgboid), Ogoni, Central Delta, Delta Edoid, and Lower Cross. The ljoid group comprises four groups of dialects namely eastern ljoid (Kalahari, Bile, Okrika, lbani and Nkoro).\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Lower Niger (lgboid) comprises dialects such as Ekpeye, lkwerre, Ogba, Egbema, Ndoni, Etche, and lgbo. The Ogoni group includes a large number of dialects which can be grouped into four Khana, Gokana, Eleme and Ogoi. The Lower Cross group has only one member in Rivers State, with the rest being in Akwa lbom and Cross River States. The language, Obolo, in this group, is spoken in Andoni and Opobo Local Government Areas (Salawu, 1993).\r\n<br><br>\r\nRivers State, with its diverse ethnic and linguistic groups, is very rich in culture and the arts. Several cultural bonds exist, particularly in music, dances, plays and masquerades. Literature in Rivers State consists of the oral tradition of folk tales, legends, myths, proverbs, riddles and poetry in religious incantations, and so on. More modem literature includes the novels and poetry of writers like Elechi Amadi, Gabriel Okara and the late Ken Saro wiwa. Production of traditional fired clay and bronze are also common.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Population Size and Distribution</h3>\r\nThe population of Rivers State is 3,187,864 (Nigeria, 1991) with 51.9 per cent of the population being males and 1,532,217 or 48.1 per cent being females. Rivers State thus account for 3.58 percent of Nigeria’s population. The population of Rivers State is unevenly distributed among LGAs, towns and villages, such that ecological and physical conditions underscore the observed population distribution pattern.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPopulation density in the State is roughly 284 persons per sq. km and against the national average of ninety six persons per sq. km., therefore the state’s population density is very high. The fact is that because of physical conditions of the state, the limited land area for agricultural practices and constant floods, Rivers State’s population is concentrated in a few towns and the state headquarters (Port Harcourt). The low density of population in the central and western parts (riverine area) is due to the limited dry and safe land area for settlement and agricultural practices. Over fifty six percent of the State’s population is concentrated in eight LGAs and out of which five of them are in the upland region of the State.\r\n\r\n<h3>Rural/Urban Settlement</h3>\r\nThe degree of urbanization in the State is very low and only nineteen out of 1,079 settlements in the State have population above 20,000. Generally, urbanization index is very low (0.24) while the main towns are Port Harcourt, Abonnema, Omoku, Okrika, Oyigbo, Elele, Bonny and Opobo.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to the 1991 population census, the population of these towns constituted 28 per cent of the State population, and therefore the low urbanization index of 0.24. With respect to urban-rural gender composition, Salawu showed that urban population had more males than females while rural population had more females than males. This is a possible reflection of the rural urban migration which is male dominated.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Problem of Urban Primacy: The primacy of Port Harcourt is not in doubt, as that city alone accounts for 14 per cent of the State population and 39 and 21 percent of state owned secondary schools and hospitals, respectively. It has the largest number of private secondary schools and hospitals and controls over 86 per cent of all manufacturing activities in the State. By 1991, the total population of Port Harcourt was 440,399, followed by Buguma (82,865) and Okrika (81,558).\r\n<br><br>\r\nThus, Port Harcourt’s population is five times larger than that of Buguma or Okrika (Nigeria, 1991). The creation of more LGAs, the number of which now stands at twenty three, economic development via industrialization, the neglect of the rural sector and sustained rural urban migration have all accelerated urban growth and development in Rivers State. The number of urban centers with population of 20,000 and above increased from one in 1963 to nineteen in 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Education</h3>\r\nThe coastal people had early contact with Europeans since the 15th century, but western education was not introduced till 1864, when the first missionary schools were established in Bonny. However, by 1916, primary schools had been established in other parts of the State such as Isiokpo, Omoku, Abua and Okrika. The first secondary school, Bonny High School, was established in 1890 by the Anglican Mission and later became Government College.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBy 1980, the number of secondary and primary schools was eighty one and 797, respectively. By 1999, the number of government owned primary and secondary schools had increased to 2,805 and 243, respectively. Secondary schools are spatially concentrated in few towns, mostly LGA headquarters and particularly in Port Harcourt. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTertiary institutions in the State include the University of Port Harcourt established by the Federal Government (1975); Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt, founded in 1980 by the State government; School of Health Technology, Port Harcourt, established by the State government; two Polytechnic Colleges, one established by the federal government at Omoku and the other by the State government at Bori; State College of Education at Rurnuolumeni, Nkpolu Oroworukwo and Ndele; and School of Nursing and Midwifery at Rumueme, Port Harcourt. There are numerous satellite campuses of the Universities of Lagos, Benin, Calabar, Nsukka, and other vocational educational institutions.\r\n\r\n<h3>Health Facilities</h3>\r\nIn each of the twenty three local government headquarters, there is at least one State hospital, while places like Port Harcourt and Ahoada have six and two hospitals, respectively. There are numerous private health centers, in addition to well equipped institutional clinics.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to Salawu, the Rivers State government, in 1980, had 190 healthcare institutions distributed throughout the then seven LGAs as follows: Ahoada LGA (31); Bori LGA (18); Degema LGA (13); lkwerre Etche LGA (41); Bonny LGA (11); Okrika, Tai Eleme LGA (15); and Port Harcourt LGA (21), (Salawu, 1993). These health care institutions include hospitals, maternity centers, and lately primary health centers where curative medical services are offered. Nowadays, emphasis is placed on maximum accessibility of the people to healthcare delivery systems, and on preventive medicine.\r\n\r\n<h3>Transport and Communications</h3>\r\nThe three modes of transportation are road, rail, and inland waterway. Because of the noted ecological problems, intrastate road networks are poorly developed. Riverine areas are not yet linked up with the settlements in the upland areas. Rail and air transportation serve mainly interstate rather than intrastate movements. The difficult terrain of the area imposes a restriction on the rate and extent of transport development and thus large parts of the state still remain isolated or inaccessible.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRecently, the State Government had established the Rivers State Transport Corporation (RTC) to facilitate interaction within the State and with other parts of the country. There are many private transport organizations that provide transport services to other big cities in the country. There are only 22km of rail road within Rivers State. Nevertheless, the importance of the railway to the State lies in the services it provides the port of Port Harcourt.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe eastern area of the railway system links with Nguru, Kaduna, Jos and Maiduguri, all in the northern parts of the country. Within Rivers State, water transportation is as important as road transportation since about two thirds of the State lies within the Niger Delta. The port of Port Harcourt is the second largest in Nigeria. Port Harcourt has one of the three major international airports in the country. Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa, was commissioned in 1978. It covers an area of about forty sq. km. and has facilities to accommodate all types of aircrafts, and serves as the gateway tor aircraft travelling to the outside world.\r\n\r\n<h3>Tourism and Recreation</h3>\r\nRivers State is very rich in tourist attractions. With its long expanses of beautiful coastal sandy beaches stretching from Opobo through Brass to Koluama, numerous long and winding creeks, streams, and rivers as well as forests with their associated shrines and wildlife, the tourism potential of Rivers State is yet to be fully tapped. As a major theatre in the slave traffic and palm oil trade of the mid nineteenth and early twentieth century’s, it is endowed with war relics, artefacts and historical monuments.\r\n<br><br>\r\nToday, the State is the centre of the petroleum industry in the country and the home of several other modern industrial establishments. Rivers State culture is rich in festivals, ceremonies; dances, music and crafts, and these are as varied and diverse as the people whose hospitality has become legendary. The rich culture of the State, which is rooted in its unique environment of lakes, creeks, rivers, forests and swamps, provides the hallmark of its tourism development.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSince the establishment of the Tourism and Hotels Corporation in 1970, the Rivers State Government has embarked upon several tourism projects. Notable among these are the Isaka Holiday Resort on a twenty three hectare island, about one nautical mile from Port Harcourt, the zoo in Trans Amadi and the Isaac Boro Leisure Park along Aba Road in Port Harcourt. Other projects include the renovation of the Jubilee Park in the Old Township and the establishment of a museum in the Secretariat Complex. These projects have been developed as a social service with the aim of providing facilities for sightseeing and recreation for residents of the State and those visiting.\r\n\r\n<h3>NATURAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>\r\nRivers State has tremendous natural resource potentials, but a sizeable proportion of these has never been quantified or exploited. Given the abundant arable land in the upland area of the State and adequate rainfall, the potential for crop production is very substantial.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Other basic Activities\r\nAn overwhelming majority of the people of Rivers State are involved in two primary activities: farming and fishing. A sample survey conducted by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources found that about forty per cent of the rural dwellers were involved in farming in 1983. The main root crops are yam, cassava and cocoyam; while the grains are maize, lowland rice and beans. Other crops grown for food include vegetables, melon, pineapples and plantain. The major cash crops are oil palm products, rubber, coconut, raffia palm and jute. Rivers State is traditionally a fishing area and the principal occupation of the riverine people is fishing and its associated industries. About 270 species of fish have been identified in this area.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe fishing population is almost exclusively dominated by artisanal fishermen. The State also provides such valuable sea foods as crabs, oysters, shrimps and fishes, as well as mammals and birds. Land use analysis reveals clearly that only a very small portion of cultivable land is presently used for crop production. This amount is estimated at about 1,060,162 ha or 54.6 per cent of arable land, consisting of all the upland area and a large portion of the Upper/Lower Delta Plains. Land use categories include cropland, plantations, forest reserves, swamps, wooded areas and built up areas.\r\n<br><br>\r\n The dominant land use category is the swamps (fresh water and saltwater tidal swamps) that are only very thinly cultivated in patches in few places. They occupy about 40 per cent of the land. They are used as fishing areas. Cropland forms a relatively large area estimated at about 60 per cent of the State’s land area. Of this amount, only about 80,000 ha or about 4 per cent of the State’s land area is cultivated annually, the rest being fallow.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe intensity of use of cropland is very low in most areas. The portion of the State land that is cultivated at greater than 50 per cent intensity is the southeast and eastern upland areas of the coastal Plantations of rubber and oil palm, developed either by government or individuals are, however, common in the northern and eastern parts of the if State. They constitute about 0.5 per cent of the land area.\r\n<br><br>\r\nForest reserves are distributed throughout the State but they are more common in the north western part of the State. Wooded areas are commonly the freshwater upper delta floodplain and isolated preserved natural forests. Built up areas constitute about 0.3 per cent of land area and are the villages and major towns, which are concentrated more on the well drained terrace uplands, the largest of which is Port Harcourt.\r\n\r\n<h3>Mineral Resources</h3>\r\nRivers State is rich in crude oil production. An enormous amount of Nigeria’s oil wealth is derived from Rivers State. The first commercial discovery of crude oil was at Oloibiri in Bayelsa State in 1956. This success was followed by the discovery of other wells at Afam in 1957, and the Ebubu and Bomu in 1958, all in present day Rivers State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThus, the State has become firmly established as one of the major oil producing centers in the nation. By 1983, Nigeria’s oil output was 450,974,545 barrels gross, of which 44.3 percent came from wells in the then Rivers State before Bayelsa was created out of it. The area’s , contribution to the overall oil revenue in the country for 1982 and 1983 stood at N2,684.99 billion and N1,676.06 billion respectively, representing 47 and 41.5 per cent of total revenue for the country. Rivers State now produces oil from 416 wells, out of the 1201 wells in the country. Associated with oil exploitation and exploration is the potential for gas production.\r\n\r\n<h3>Local Sourcing of Raw Materials</h3>\r\nRivers State is second to Lagos in respect of industrial development. The natural resource potentials of the state include wide ranging agricultural and industrial mineral products, from which raw materials can be sourced for the establishment of low, medium and large scale industries. Agricultural raw materials for agro allied industries include rubber, oil palm, palm kernel, cassava, vegetables, rubber, timber, rope etc. Raw materials for medium to large scale industries include petrochemicals such as carbon black and polypropylene, petroleum, natural gas, bitumen, and a host of others.\r\n\r\n<h3>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES</h3>\r\nRivers State produces strategic minerals (especially crude oil and gas) and other agricultural products which can all be mobilized for the State’s economic growth and development. The present State government and the Federal Government, in their planning and development policies, both aim at pursuing a vigorous diversification of the Nigerian economy.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo this extent, the State government has created an enabling economic environment that attracts local and international entrepreneurs to the State. Firstly, the State maintains social and political peace among indigenous and non-indigenous elements residing in the State through regular dialogue between the government on one hand, and the indigenous and non indigenous population residing in the State on the other.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSecondly, the State has created the Ministry of Energy Resources charged with responsibility for providing electricity in all villages and towns of the state. Thirdly, the provision of 1,000 housing units in Port Harcourt within the first six months of the present state administration portends well for accelerated development in the State. In addition to all these, the State government has embarked on the construction of roads and bridges to link Port Harcourt with the suburban towns and villages so that transportation will be facilitated.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIntra city roads are being reconstructed, while the Federal Government has started the construction of the Bolo Bonny and Emuoha Kalahari long bridges over swamps. The construction of these two bridges will open the riverine areas for economic and industrial growth and development. In addition to the Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, the State government has started construction of a new industrial estate at Ahoada, so as to decongest Port Harcourt and transmit development impulses to the neighborhood towns and villages.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOther incentives to investors and developers include tax holidays, tax relief, provision of uninterrupted portable water supply, and pioneer status scheme for newly established industries in order to survive the initial capital outlay and other related problems. With large scale industries, such as oil refineries, petrochemical, fertilizer and liquefied natural gas, manufacturing companies and other oil service industries in the state, industrial and economic development of the State have a very bright future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),
(12, 'Sokoto', '', '<h3>HISTORY AND STRUCTURE OF SOKOTO STATE</h3>\r\nSokoto, usually referred to as Sokoto State to distinguish it from the city of Sokoto, is located in the extreme northwest of Nigeria, near to the confluence of the Sokoto River and the Rima River. As of 2005 it has an estimated population of more than 4.2 million. Sokoto City is the modern-day capital of Sokoto State (and its predecessor, the Northwestern State).\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe name Sokoto (which is the modern/anglicised version of the local name, Sakkwato) is of Arabic origin, representing suk, \"market\". It is also known as Sakkwato, Birnin Shaihu da Bello or \"Sokoto, Capital of Shaihu and Bello\").\r\n<br><br>\r\nBeing the seat of the former Sokoto Caliphate, the city is predominantly Muslim and an important seat of Islamic learning in Nigeria. The Sultan who heads the caliphate is effectively the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims. \r\n<h3>History of Sokoto State</h3>\r\nSince its creation as a state in 1976 (from the bifurcation of the erstwhile North-Western State (Map) into Sokoto and Niger States, Sokoto state has been ruled by governors, most ex-military officers, who succeeded each another at short intervals.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSokoto, as a region, knows a longer history. During the reign of the Fulani Empire in the 19th century Sokoto was an important Fula state, in addition to being a city, of what was then west central Nigeria.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom ca. 1900, with the British take-over, Sokoto, which then encompassed the entire north-west corner of Nigeria, became a province of the British protectorate of Nigeria. Not long after Gando was added as a sub-province.[4] This double province then covered an area of 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) with an estimated population over 500,000. It included the then Zamfara and Argungun, or Kebbi, kingdoms.\r\n<br><br>\r\n    The province has been organized on the same principle as the other provinces of Northern Nigeria. A British resident of the first class has been placed at Sokoto and assistant residents at other centres. British courts of justice have been established and British governors are quartered in the province. Detachments of civil police are also placed at the principal stations. The country has been assessed under the new system for taxes and is being opened as rapidly as possible for trade. After the establishment of British rule farmers and herdsmen reoccupied districts and the inhabitants of cities flocked back to the land, rebuilding villages which had been deserted for fifty years. Horse breeding and cattle raising form the chief source of wealth in the province. There is some ostrich farming. Except in the sandy areas there is extensive agriculture, including rice and cotton. Special crops are grown in the valleys by irrigation. Weaving, dyeing and tanning are the principal native industries. Fair roads are in process of construction through the province. Trade is increasing and a cash currency has been introduced.\r\n<br><br>\r\n    In 1906 a rising attributed to religious fanaticism occurred near Sokoto in which unfortunately three white officers lost their lives. The emir heartily repudiated the leader of the rising, who claimed to be a Mahdi inspired to drive the white man out of the country. A British force marched against the rebels, who were overthrown with great loss in March 1906. The leader was condemned to death in the emir\'s court and executed in the market place of Sokoto, and the incident was chiefly interesting for the display of loyalty to the British administration which it evoked on all sides from the native rulers.[4]\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1967, not long after Nigeria\'s independence from the British, the region became known as the Northwestern State. This territory was, in 1976, split into Sokoto State and Niger State. Later on, Kebbi State (1991) and Zamfara State (1996) split off from Sokoto State.\r\nDemographics\r\n<br><br>\r\nSokoto State is mainly populated by Hausa people.[5] Most Sokoto State residents are Sunni Muslims, with a Shia minority; violence between the two groups is uncommon. Over 80% of people living in the state practice agriculture.\r\n<h3>Climate</h3>\r\n\r\nSokoto State is in the dry Sahel, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith an annual average temperature of 28.3 °C (82.9 °F), Sokoto is, on the whole, a very hot area. However, maximum daytime temperatures are for most of the year generally under 40 °C (104.0 °F) and the dryness makes the heat bearable. The warmest months are February to April when daytime temperatures can exceed 45 °C (113.0 °F). The rainy season is from June to October during which showers are a daily occurrence. The showers rarely last long and are a far cry from the regular torrential rain known in wet tropical regions. From late October to February, during the cold season, the climate is dominated by the Harmattan wind blowing Sahara dust over the land. The dust dims the sunlight thereby lowering temperatures significantly and also leading to the inconvenience of dust everywhere in houses.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe region\'s lifeline for growing crops is the floodplains of the Sokoto-Rima river system (see Sokoto River), which are covered with rich alluvial soil. For the rest, the general dryness of the region allows for few crops, millet perhaps being the most abundant, complemented by rice, corn, other cereals and beans. Apart from tomatoes few vegetables grow in the region. ');

(13, 'Adamawa', '', '<h3>HISTORY AND STRUCTURE OF ADAMAWA STATE</h3>\r\nAdamawa is a state in northeastern Nigeria, with its capital at Yola. In 1991, when Taraba State was carved out from Gongola State, the geographical entity Gongola State was renamed Adamawa State, with four administrative divisions: Adamawa, Michika, Ganye, Mubi and Numan.[1] It is the home of the American University of Nigeria in Yola, Modibbo Adama University of Technology Yola, Adamawa State Polytechnic, Yola and Adamawa State college of Nursing and Midwifery. It is one of the thirty-six states that constitute the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOn May 14, 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in Adamawa State, along with neighboring Borno State and Yobe State, due to the activities of Boko Haram.[3]\r\n\r\n<h3>Geography</h3>\r\n\r\nAdamawa is one of the largest states of Nigeria and occupies about 36,917 square kilometres. It is bordered by the states of Borno to the northwest, Gombe to the west and Taraba to the southwest. Its eastern border forms the national eastern border with Cameroon.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTopographically, it is a mountainous land crossed by the large river valleys – Benue, Gongola and Yedsarem. The valleys of the Mount Cameroon, Mandara Mountains and Adamawa Plateau form part of the landscape.\r\nEconomy\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe major occupation of the people is farming as reflected in their two notable vegetational zones, the Sub-Sudan and Northern Guinea Savannah zones. Their cash crops are cotton and groundnuts while food crops include maize, yam, cassava, guinea corn, millet and rice.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe village communities living on the banks of the rivers engage in fishing while the Fulanis are cattle rearers. The state has a network of roads linking all parts of the country.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe development of many communities in the state can be traced to the colonial era when the Germans ruled a swath of territory known as the Northern and Southern Kameruns from Dikwa in the North to Victoria (Limbe) on the Atlantic coast in the 19th century. These were, however, handed over as United Nations Trust Territories to the British at the end of the World War I with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. After a series of referendums, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province, and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French speaking Cameroon.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAdamawa State is home to the headquarters of two indigenous churches, the Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN Church) with its headquarters in Mubi in the northern zone of the state, and the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN Church) with headquarters in Numan in the southern zone of the state. The Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN church) was founded in Garkida Gombi Local Government of the state in March 1923 by American missionaries. The Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN Church) was founded in Numan by Dutch missionaries in 1913.\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore it became a state in Nigeria, Adamawa was a subordinate kingdom of the Sultanate of Sokoto which also included much of northern Cameroon. The rulers bear the title of emir (\"lamido\" in the local language, Fulfulde).\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe name \"Adamawa\" came from the founder of the kingdom, Modibo Adama, a regional leader of the Fulani Jihad organized by Usman dan Fodio of Sokoto in 1804. Modibo Adama came from the region of Gurin (now just a small village) and in 1806, received a green flag for leading the jihad in his native country. In the following years, Adama conquered many lands and tribes. In 1838, he moved his capital to Ribadu, and in 1839, to Joboliwo. In 1841, he founded Yola, where he died in 1848. After the European colonization (first by Germany and then by Britain), the rulers remained as emirs and the line of succession has continued to the present day. '),
(14, 'Bauchi', '', '<h3>HISTORY AND STRUCTURE OF BAUCHI STATE</h3>\r\nBauchi, usually referred to as Bauchi State to distinguish it from the city of Bauchi, is a state in northern Nigeria. Its capital is the city of Bauchi. The state was formed in 1976 when the former North-Eastern State was broken up. It originally included the area now in Gombe State, which became a distinct state in 1996.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University is located in the capital city Bauchi. Other educational institutions located in the state include Bauchi State University, Abubakar Tatari Ali Polytechnic[6] and Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi. \r\n<h3>\r\nName\r\n</h3>\r\nAccording to tradition, it was named for a hunter known as Baushe, who settled in the region before the arrival of Yakubu, the first traditional ruler of Bauchi emirate (founded 1800–10).[7]\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn Hausa the word Bauchi means the land of freedom and tourism.[8] Bauchi and Adamawa were the two main sources of freedom and tourism for the Fulani empire of Sokoto.[9]\r\nHistory\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhat is now known as Bauchi was until 1976 a province in the then North-Eastern State of Nigeria. According to the 2006 census, the state has a population of 4,653,066.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBauchi State has gone through tremendous transformation over the years. The Ajawa language was spoken in Bauchi State, but became extinct between 1920 and 1940 as speakers switched to Hausa.[10]\r\n<br><br>\r\nDuring the colonial era up to independence, it formed part of the Bauchi Plateau of the then Northern Region, until the 1967 state creation exercise, when the Bauchi, Borno, and Adamawa provinces constituted the former North-Eastern State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith the creation of Bauchi State in 1976, then comprising present Bauchi and Gombe states, it included 16 local government areas. The number of local government areas in the then Bauchi State was increased to 20 and later to 23. However, in 1997 when Gombe State was created out of Bauchi and additional local governments were created in the country\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nGeography</h3>\r\n\r\nBauchi State occupies a total land area of 49,119 km2 (18,965 sq mi) representing about 5.3% of Nigeria\'s total land mass and is located between latitudes 9° 3\' and 12° 3\' north and longitudes 8° 50\' and 11° east.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe state is bordered by seven states, Kano and Jigawa to the north, Taraba and Plateau to the south, Gombe and Yobe to the east and Kaduna to the west.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBauchi state is one of the states in the northern part of Nigeria that span two distinctive vegetation zones, namely, the Sudan savannah and the Sahel savannah. The Sudan savannah type of vegetation covers the southern part of the state. Here, the vegetation gets richer and richer towards the south, especially along water sources or rivers, but generally the vegetation is less uniform and grasses are shorter than what grows even farther south, that is, in the forest zone of the middle belt.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Sahel type of savannah, also known as semi-desert vegetation, becomes manifest from the middle of the state as one moves from the state\'s south to its north. This type of vegetation comprises isolated stands of thorny shrubs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOn the other hand, the southwestern part of the state is mountainous as a result of the continuation of the Jos Plateau, while the northern part is generally sandy.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe vegetation types as described above are conditioned by the climatic factors, which in turn determine the amount of rainfall received in the area. For instance, the rainfall in Bauchi state ranges between 1,300 millimetres (51 in) per annum in the south and only 700 millimetres (28 in) per annum in the extreme north. This pattern is because in the West Africa sub-region, rains generally come from the south as they are carried by the southwesterlies. There is therefore a progressive dryness towards the north, culminating in the desert condition in the far north. So also is the case in Bauchi state.\r\n<br><br>\r\nConsequently, rains start earlier in the southern part of the state, where rain is heaviest and lasts longer. Here the rains start in April with the highest record amount of 1,300 millimetres (51 in) per annum. In contrast, the northern part of the state receives the rains late, usually around June or July, and records the highest amount of 700 millimetres (28 in) per annum.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the same vein, the weather experienced in the south and the north varies considerably. While it is humidly hot during the early part of the rainy season in the south, the hot, dry and dusty weather lingers up north.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn addition to rainfall, Bauchi state is watered by a number of rivers. They include the Gongola and Jama\'are rivers.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Gongola River crosses Bauchi state in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area in the south and in Kirfi and Alkaleri Local Government Areas in the eastern part of the state, while the Jama’are River cuts across a number of Local Government Areas in the northern part of the state. Moreover, a substantial part of the Hadeja-Jama\'are River basin lies in Bauchi state, which along with various fadama (floodplain) areas in the state provides suitable land for agricultural activities. These are further supported by the number of dams meant for irrigation and other purposes. These include the Gubi and Tilde-Fulani dams. There also lakes such as the Maladumba Lake in Misau Local Government Area that further provide the necessary conditions to support Agriculture.<h3>\r\nPopulation</h3>\r\n\r\nBauchi State has a total of 55 tribal groups in which Gerawa, Sayawa, Jarawa, Kirfawa, Turawa Bolewa, Karekare, Kanuri, Fa\'awa, Butawa, Warjawa, Zulawa, Boyawa MBadawa, Hausa and Fulani are the main tribes. This means that they have backgrounds, occupational patterns, beliefs and many other things that form part of the existence of the people of the state.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are cultural similarities in the people\'s language, occupational practices, festivals, dress and there is a high degree of ethnic interaction especially in marriage and economic existence. Some of the ethnic groups have joking relationships that exist between them, e.g. Fulani and Kanuri, Jarawa and Sayawa, etc. '),
(15, 'Taraba', '', '<h3>HISTORY AND STRUCTURE OF TARABA STATE</h3>\r\n Taraba is a state in North Eastern Nigeria, named after the Taraba River which traverses the southern part of the state. Taraba\'s capital is Jalingo. \r\n\r\n\r\n <h3>History</h3>\r\n\r\nThe state was created out of the former Gongola State on 27 August 1991, by the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida.\r\nGeography\r\n<br><br>\r\nTaraba State is bounded in the west by Nasarawa State and Benue State, northwest by Plateau State, north by Bauchi State and Gombe State, northeast by Adamawa State, east and south by Cameroon.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTaraba State lies largely within the middle of Nigeria and consists of undulating landscape dotted with a few mountainous features. These include the scenic and prominent Mambilla Plateau. The state lies largely within the tropical zone and has a vegetation of low forest in the southern part and grassland in the northern part. The Mambilla Plateau with an altitude of 1,800 meters (6000 ft) above sea level has a temperate climate all year round.[citation needed]\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Benue, Donga, Taraba and Ibi are the main rivers in the state. They rise from the Cameroonian mountains, straining almost the entire length of the state in the North and South direction to link up with the River Niger. \r\n\r\n<h3>Agriculture</h3>\r\n\r\nThe major occupation of the people of Taraba State is agriculture. Cash crops produced in the state include coffee, tea, groundnuts and cotton.[citation needed] Crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, millet, cassava, and yam are also produced in commercial quantity.[citation needed] In addition, cattle, sheep and goats are reared in large numbers, especially on the Mambilla Plateau, and along the Benue and Taraba valleys.[citation needed] Similarly, the people undertake other livestock production activities like poultry production, rabbit breeding and pig farming in fairly large scale. Communities living on the banks of River Benue, River Taraba, River Donga and Ibi engage in fishing all year round. Other occupational activities such as pottery, cloth-weaving, dyeing, mat-making, carving, embroidery and blacksmithing are also carried out in various parts of the State.[citation needed]\r\nCulture\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe government has made concerted efforts to improve areas of tourist attractions like Mambilla Tourist Center, Gumpti Park and game reserve in Gashaka; and the Nwunyu fishing festival in Ibi, which is usually held in April of each year where activities such as canoe racing, swimming competition and cultural dances are held. Other festivals are Purma of the Chamba in Donga, Takum and jibu culture dance in Bali, the Puje of Jukuns, Kuchecheb of Kutebs in Takum and Ussa[5], Kati of the Mambilla and host of others. Taraba is called \"Nature\'s gift to the nation\" as the state is rich and have many ethnic groups, including Jenjo, Jibana, Kuteb Chamba, Yandang, Mumuyes, Mambila, Wurkums, Fulanis, Jukun, Ichen, Tiv, Kaka, Pena, Kambu, Wawa, Vute, Hausa and Ndola.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA striking historical fact about the State is that it encompasses part of the Mambilla Region which is famed as the Bantu cradle, having been occupied for some five millennia to date (Schwartz, 1972; Zeitlyn & Connell, 2003).

(16, 'Zamfara', '', '<h3>HISTORY AND STRUCTURE OF ZAMFARA STATE</h3>\r\nZamfara is a state in northwestern Nigeria. Its capital is Gusau and its Governor is Bello Matawalle, a member of the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP). Until 1996 the area was part of Sokoto State.\r\n<br><br>\r\nZamfara is populated with the Hausa and Fulani peoples. Major groups of people are the Zamfarawa mainly in Anka, Gummi, Bukkuyum and Talata Mafara Local Governments areas. Gobirawa populated Shinkafi Local Government. Gobirawa actually migrated from the Gobir Kingdom. Burmawa are found in Bakura and Fulani peopled Bungudu, Maradun, Gusau and are scattered all over the State. In Tsafe, Bungudu and Maru Local Governments are mainly Katsinawa, Garewatawa and Hadejawa. While Alibawa peopled Kaura Namoda and Zurmi.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe people of Zamfara have over the years struggled for autonomy, it was not until 1996 that the then military administration of the Late General Sani Abacha detached the Zamfara State from Sokoto State. With an area of 38,418 square kilometres, it is bordered in the North by Niger republic, to the South by Kaduna State. In the east, it is bordered by Katsina State and to the West by Sokoto and Niger States. It has a population of 3,278,873 according to the 2006 census and contains fourteen local government areas. \r\n<h3>\r\nHistory</h3>\r\n\r\nThe area today called Zamfara state was one of the old Hausa city-states like Kano, Katsina, Gobir, Kabi and Zazzau. The earliest inhabitants of Zamfara were said to have been hunters and giants. They established their first settlement at Dutsi which was the first capital of Zamfara. It extends up to the bend of River Rima to the north west and River Ka in the south west. Zamfara Kingdom was established in the 11th century and flourished up to 16th century as a city-state. Its capital has shifted with the fortunes of the kingdom from place to place like Dutsi and Birnin Zamfara. In the first half of the 18th century, its then capital Birnin Zamfara, was destroyed by the Gobir Kingdom and a new capital was established in Anka by the second half of the 19th century. Zamfara had many centers of commerce and scholarship that attracted many scholars like the Yandoto city. It became part of the Sokoto Caliphate after the 1804 jihad by Usman dan Fodio. In fact, Usman Danfodiyo settled in Sabon Gari where Sarkin Zamfara Abarshi had already established a garrison headquarters during the early days of his Jihad as a base from where fought Gobir and Kabi.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt the wake of British colonialism, the emerging town of Gusau became an important commercial and administrative center with road and rail networks passing through it. With the creation of states during the Gowon Administration, Zamfara Kingdom became part of the then North West state and later the Sokoto State.\r\nClimate\r\nThe climatic condition of Zamfara is tropical, with temperatures rising up to 38 °C (100.4 °F) and above between March to May. Rainy season starts in late May to September while the mild season known as Harmattan lasts from December to February. \r\n<h3>\r\nDemographics</h3>\r\n\r\nZamfara State is mainly populated by Hausa and Fulani people, with some members of Gwari, Kamuku, Kambari, Dukawa, Bussawa and Zabarma ethnic communities.[4] Others include the Igbo, Yoruba, Kanuri, Nupe and Tiv.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe state capital is an important commercial center with a heterogeneous population of people from all over Nigeria. As in all major towns in Nigeria, all the major towns in Zamfara have a large population of other peoples from different parts of Nigeria.\r\nLanguages\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Kainji languages C\'Lela and Gwamhi-Wuri are spoken in Gummi LGA. Ut-Ma\'in is also spoken in the state and in Kebbe, Sokoto State. Major languages are Hausa and Fulani.[5]\r\nEconomy\r\n<br><br>\r\nAgriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state and the central source of income. Irrigation is required for cereals and legumes hence its slogan \"farming is our pride\". And also Home Of Shari\'ah. \r\n<h3>\r\nIncidents</h3>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, gold mining became a greater source of income in Zamfara State as worldwide gold prices rose dramatically.[6] High concentrations of lead in the ore from which gold was being extracted led to a lead poisoning epidemic in the state, requiring national and international intervention to remediate affected areas and provide medical care to children with severe lead poisoning.<h3>\r\nReligion</h3>\r\n\r\nIslam is the principal and major religion of the state. Zamfara was the first state in Nigeria to introduce Sharia law during the regime of Ahmad Sani Yerima, the former Governor of the state. Christianity also has many adherents. The original native religions also remain but they have the fewest followers. These religions are mainly practiced in ancient settlements like Dutsi and Kwatarkwashi.<h3>\r\nLanguage</h3>\r\nHausa is the official language of the state. Other main languages spoken in Zamfara are English, French, Fulfulde, Arabic; minority populations also speak languages like: Yoruba and Igbo. ');
